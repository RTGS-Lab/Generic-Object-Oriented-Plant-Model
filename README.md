Object-Oriented Process-Based Crop Model
Overview
This Object-Oriented Process-Based Crop Model is a pioneering effort spearheaded by Sajad Jamshidi, under the guidance of Dr. Diane Wang, within the ambit of an ambitious project targeting the development of a base generic plant model. This model is specifically designed to facilitate the exploration of Genotype by Environment (GxE) scenarios, thereby advancing our understanding of crop performance under varying conditions. Originating from a procedural crop model framework, this iteration of the model represents a significant leap forward, employing an object-oriented design to enhance modularity, scalability, and ease of adaptation.

Key Features
Object-Oriented Design: Incorporating key objects such as Soil, Atmosphere, Canopy, Leaf, and Root, alongside a controller for managing temporal inputs and outputs, this design paradigm enhances the model's flexibility and adaptability.
Focus on C3 Crops: The model currently specializes in simulating C3 crop processes, with provisioned placeholders for future extension to C4 crops, indicating a roadmap for comprehensive crop modeling.
Continuous Development: Initiated in January 2024, the model is in a state of ongoing development, reflecting a commitment to refinement and the incorporation of cutting-edge research findings.
Open-Source Licensing: Available under the MIT License, the model invites collaboration, modification, and extension by the global research community, fostering innovation and shared progress.
