# Procedural Process-Based Crop Model

This repository contains the procedural process-based crop model developed by Sajad Jamshidi in Dr. Diane Wang's lab. This effort is part of an ongoing project aimed at developing a base generic plant model adaptable for exploring Genotype by Environment (GxE) scenarios. The model presented here builds upon and significantly improves the previous prototype plant model based on a comprehensive literature review and the evaluation of other crop models conducted during Fall 2023.

## Key Features
- **Procedural Design**: Initially designed as a procedural model to lay the groundwork for future development into an object-oriented framework.
- **Foundation for GxE Exploration**: Serves as a foundational model for studying the interaction between genetic variation and environmental factors.
- **Improvement and Expansion**: Extends the capabilities of the previous version by incorporating findings and methodologies from recent literature and crop model evaluations.

## Development Notes
This version represents an experimental phase in the model's evolution, focusing on developing a procedural framework as a precursor to a more robust object-oriented model. The next phase of development will involve a transition to an object-oriented design, which will undergo extensive testing and refinement.

## Usage and Contribution
This model is released under the MIT license, allowing for free use, modification, and distribution. Contributors and users are encouraged to participate in the ongoing development and enhancement of the model.

## Disclaimer
Please note that this version has not been extensively tested. It represents a trial development phase aimed at establishing a procedural modeling approach. Feedback and contributions are highly welcomed to aid in the transition to an object-oriented model and its subsequent testing and validation.
