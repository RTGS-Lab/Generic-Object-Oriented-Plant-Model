# Prototype Plant Model
Prototype Plant Model is a Python package offering a simplified plant growth simulation based on the mathematical modeling concepts introduced in "Introduction to Mathematical Modeling of Crop Growth: How the Equations are Derived and Assembled Into a Computer Model" by Christopher Teh (1).
Originally provided in C++, the code has been translated into Python with some modifications to serve as a toy model. This project aims to illustrate the interconnectedness of various components in a crop simulation model, making it easier for students to understand the underlying mechanics of plant growth modeling.
The users can install the package directly from GitHub, and the package configuration is defined in a `pyproject.toml` file.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.x (replace with the minimum version your package requires)
- pip 19.0 or newer (for `pyproject.toml` support)

### Installing Directly from GitHub

You can install PrototypePlantModel directly from GitHub using pip. This method requires an internet connection and git installed on your system.

To install the latest version, run:
